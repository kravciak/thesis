The goal of this paper is to inform readers about high availability problematics and provide basic overview of free technologies you can use to achieve high availability. I focus mainly on solution of problems caused by hardware failures. Document can by used to gain basic knowledge needed for configuration of your own solution. In practical part I will try to realize high available cluster using free technologies and compare performance of different filesystems on this platform. Document will provide instructions for choosing and testing appropriate filesystem for specific configuration that can be used in production environment.
